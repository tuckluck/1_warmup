# 1_warmup
ME 700 Assignment 1 - Warmup 

This tutorial aims to show a user how to use the "bisect_warmup" function to solve difficult, single variable ("x"), algebraic equations using the bisect method. The function, as outlined below, allows the user to enter an equation, a lower bound estimate for the possible solution and an upper bound estimate for the possible solution. The user should enter the equation as a string using quotations (ex. "3*x = 3"). 

Example of calling the function:
bisect_warmup("3*x=3",0,2)

I used chatGPT while creating this function to learn how to read symbols from equation strings, to use the sympy library and to perform calculations by subbing in a number for a variable.
